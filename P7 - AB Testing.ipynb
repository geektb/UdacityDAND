    "## [Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1aCquhIqsUApgsxQ8-SQBAigFDcfWVVohLEXcV6jWbdI/pub?embedded=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the home page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. [This screenshot shows](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/a/knowlabs.com/file/d/0ByAfiG8HpNUMakVrS0s4cGN2TjQ/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1483665587054000&usg=AFQjCNF2NgKQ6yp6gIScG_0PAdjCG45EbQ) what the experiment looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n",

    "* **Number of clicks:** That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). (dmin=240)\n",
    "* **Click-through-probability:** That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=0.01)\n",
    "* **Gross conversion:** That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. (dmin= 0.01)\n",
    "* **Retention:** That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. (dmin=0.01)\n",
    "* **Net conversion:** That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. (dmin= 0.0075)"

    "##### List which metrics you will use as invariant metrics and evaluation metrics here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Invariant Metrics:** Number of cookies, Number of clicks, and Click through probability.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Metrics:** Gross conversion and Net conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For each metric, explain both why you did or did not use it as an invariant metric and why you did or did not use it as an evaluation metric. Also, state what results you will look for in your evaluation metrics in order to launch the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Number of cookies:** This is an invariant metric because the cookies are created on first visit to any page on the site and should not be affected by change.\n",
    "* **Number of user-ids:** Users IDs is not a good invariant because it can be affected by the change (number of new users who create an account in order to participate in free trial). It is also not a good evaluation metric because the mix of new vs existing users can be different between the control and experiment group.\n",
    "* **Number of clicks:** This is an invariant metric because the action of clicking on the \"start free trail\" happens before the 5-hour question is shown so the user experience should be the same across both groups.\n",
    "* **Click-through-probability:** Similar to the Number of Clicks, this is also a good invariant metric because the probability of click on the \"start free trail\" happens before any the user experience starts to differ between the groups.\n",
    "* **Gross conversion:** This is a good evaluation metric because it is dependent on the effect of the \"5 hours\" message on whether a user decides to sign up or not, and is part of what is being tested. it is not a good invariant metric because of its dependency.\n",
    "* **Retention:** This is a good evaluation metric because it is dependent on the effect of the \"5 hours\" message since the point of the message was to decrease the number of users that cancel prior to the end of the 14-day trial. Having said that, I chose to not include Retention as an evaluation metric because the numerator of Retention is the same as Net Conversion but the unit of diversion is user-ids and not unique cookies like Gross and Net Conversion. For ease of analysis, I will focus on Gross and Net Conversion only. It is not a good invariant metric because of its dependency.\n",
    "* **Net conversion:** This is a good evaluation metric because it captures the users who stayed engaged and made at least one payment. Since we would like to decrease expense and **maintain or increase revenue** we need to make sure that the change we made did not have a negative effect on the number of paying users. It is not a good invariant metric because of its dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the change is to reduce the time coaches spend helping non-paying students so I chose to look at both **Gross conversion** and **Net conversion** since they are the measurements we will use to evaluate potential changes to both cost and revenue. A successful experiment should show a practically and statistically significant decrease in Gross conversion because of better expectation settings. In addition, the Net conversion metric should remain the same or increase, indicating that the change is not likely to discourage signup of users that would have continued past the 14-day trial."

    "The negative and the practically and statistically significant results of the Gross Conversion indicate that the change is discouraging users from signing up by letting the users know how much time they would need to invest per week in order to be successful and less users are signing up for the free trial. This means that Udacity can potentially save money by limiting the amount of time the coaches spend helping non-paying students.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, although the Net Conversion came out as practically and statistically insignificant, the fact that the lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval are a negative number may indicate a potential for loss of revenue, perhaps from users that were discouraged from signing up but would have otherwise paid at least one payment.\n",

    "\n",
    "For a follow up experiment I would recommend looking at the number of payments made by each student. The same results dataset can be used as long as Udacity can link the experiment results back to the specific users and retrieve the number and amount of all payments they made after registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the results of this experiment showed that there was no significant change in in the Net Conversion value, I think that a deeper look will reveal that by implementing this change, Udacity will be able to focus its resources more effectively and increase it's per user margin. In addition to the financial benefits, student satisfaction and rate of success may also improve, along with a reduction in negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "My **hypothesis** is that using the same experiment (i.e. implementing the same 5-hour prompt message) may result in an equal or lower number of users making at least one payment, but the overall revenue generated by these users would be higher as they are more likely to make more than a single payment. This type of analysis will help Udacity evaluate not just initial potential for revenue but also compare the overall worth of the users over time. The experiment itself would be the same but results would only be available after a longer period of time so enough data is available for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **unit of diversion** will be the number of payments per user-id and the **evaluation metrics** will be the count of those payments after specific time intervals (for example, number of payments each month after registration, up to the average number of months it takes users to finish a course) so we can evaluate if the change between the control and experiment group is statistically and practically significant.\n",
